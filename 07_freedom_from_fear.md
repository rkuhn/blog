# Freedom from Fear

Recently, the phrase «your freedom ends where mine begins» has been used more frequently in the context of the pandemic.
We’ll get to sources of this pseudo-quote further down.
The purpose of this article is to illuminate one particularly nasty way in which this apparently sound principle is abused and contorted.

## A thought experiment

Imagine a conversation between two fictitious personas representing current strife:
one who mandates to forcibly vaccinate others, and one who refuses to be forced — whether this second persona would voluntarily take the shot otherwise is a different question.
Here, we deliberately choose to explore the situation where the first position is motivated and justified by fear:

- fear of them or their loved ones getting infected
- fear of severe illness and death
- fear of new variants of the virus
- fear of societal collapse

Whether these fears correspond to actual risks is immaterial for this thought experiment, more on this later.
The first persona is in a dreadful position, a joyful life is unlikely while such fears reside in a human mind.
It thus seems reasonable to restore this persona’s ability to pursue happiness removing the cause of the fear, i.e. by vaccinating all humans.
Whether vaccination actually mitigates the risks is again immaterial, since fear is irrational.

Taking stock, we have concluded that due to the freedom rights of the first persona everyone, including the second persona, needs to get vaccinated.

Now, taking a look from the other perspective, it is only fair to assume that the second persona is also motivated by fear.
They might be horrified by syringes, or terrified of a foreign substance circulating in their veins or by possibly fatal side effects.
Following the same argument, it would again be reasonable to restore this persona’s ability to pursue happiness by foregoing vaccination.
And since these fears are no less irrational than the others, it is again immaterial if there are actual risks corresponding to them.

We have reached an impasse: if we apply the same rules and reasoning to both personas, then we must at the same time forcibly vaccinate and forego vaccination.

Such a contradiction can only arise if its seed is already included in our premise
(in mathematical terms, if you start from falsehood then you can prove anything you like, even with correct reasoning).

## What do we learn from this?

*As demonstrated above, the argument “I have a right to freedom from fear” is flawed, we cannot use it.*

This finding also makes sense regarding responsibilities: everybody is responsible for their own fears.
For this reason, neuroses and psychoses are considered as illnesses and treated accordingly.
The norm is that every human learns to control their fears well enough to be able to partake in society.

So if we want to resolve the conflict in the thought experiment above, we need to take fear out of the equation.
The first persona needs to assess the actual risks and severities attached to getting infected, falling sick, encountering new virus variants, or societal collapse.
Likewise, the second persona needs to assess the actual risks and severities of being punctured by a syringe, injected with an approved vaccine, or suffering fatal side-effects.
To keep this article on point, I won’t even try to go into the details here.

## Quotes and context

Besides the quantification of risks, there are other aspects to consider, which brings us back to the occasion of this article.
Most people who I saw use the initial quote, attributed it to Immanuel Kant.
He said something similar, but a lot more precise:

> No one can force me to be happy after their fashion, but everyone may choose their own path to pursue happiness, as long as they don’t deny such a right — if consistent with a common law applicable to veveryone — to someone else.  — [link](https://korpora.zim.uni-duisburg-essen.de/Kant/aa08/290.html#z27)

Kant explicitly includes the requirement that my freedom limits yours only if my freedom is based on common law that can equally be applied to you and me.
In other words, I can only demand of you what you can demand of me; freedom from fear clearly fails this test.

Another manifestation of this principle can be found in Article 2 of the German constitution:

> Everyone has the right to free development of their personality, provided that they don’t violate the rights of others and the constitutional order.

The mentioned rights refer to the collection of civil rights of which this article is one.
The civil rights circumscribe the protected sphere which belongs to each citizen and where that citizen is fully responsible for making use of their rights and liberties as they see fit.
